Angular provides two different approaches to handling user input through forms,
reactive and template-driven. Both capture user input events from the view,
validate the user input, create a form model and data model to update, and
provide a way to track changes.

## Reactive Form
- Reactive forms are more scalable than template-driven forms
## Template Driven Form
- they don't scale as much as reactive form
- focus on simple scenarios and are not as reusable.

- FormControl
- FormGroup
- FormArray
- FormRecord
